			<p>Syracuse, NY has the highest child poverty rate of all “large US cities” according to a new U.S. Census report. 
			The city has a rate of 48.3%, down about 5% from its previous 5-year measurement taken in 2018. These numbers are nothing new for Syracuse: it has posted percentages in the 40s in three of the last five years, one outlier being in the 50% range. The city’s high percentages affect many quality of life variables. A significant one being education.

			<p>The steep poverty rate makes it hard for Syracuse students to be fully involved in their education.
<br>
				Executive Director of Syracuse Say Yes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwpp3QfEKwAOJ8hciKXoTNkLxBFjnlTT-gad_52rHv8/edit?usp=sharing ">Ahmeed Turner</a> said students who live in poverty often struggle with attendance in school. “Their environment outside of school plays a key part, there are a lot of distractions.”
				<br><br>
				To counteract these disctractions, Turner says Syracuse has many programs to make learning more exciting and accessible for students. OnPoint for College “helps you with your college application," Turner said. The Science and Technology entry program will “expose 7th to 10th grade students to the many careers that are offered in STEM.”  
				<br><br>
				While efforts are being made to keep students interested in the classroom, the financial variable still turns students elsewhere -- Jobs.
				<br><br>
				Paired with a high poverty rate is obviously a low average income: the average Syracuse family of 4 takes home just over $30,000 annually according to <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/12/syracuse-has-nations-worst-child-poverty-rate-we-dont-want-to-be-first-for-that.html#:~:text=Syracuse's%20overall%20poverty%20rate%20was,an%20overall%20rate%20of%2029.6%25.">Syracuse.com,</a> Turner stated that when children are forked with going to class or going to work to financially support their families, they opt for the latter.
				<br><br>
				“A lot of students feel that they have to enter the workforce to help out with their family. I can't tell you how many students I come across that choose to get a job so they can help with the family financial obligations.” 
				<br><br>
				Turner coins higher education as “the most effective bridge out of poverty”. In addition to funding the family, other roadblocks exist as well. Some Syracuse students lose motivation due to experiences with underqualified Syracuse City School District teachers. 
				<br><br>
				“It takes four years to get rid of an ineffective teacher,” Turner stated. “Teachers that are ineffective will shape how students feel about pursuing education after they're done with high school. If you get to high school and your ninth grade English teacher was terrible, that might just set you off on a trajectory to not pursue college.” 
				<br><br>
				While there’s no data to support this claim, Turner has been working with high school students as an executive for almost three years and has remained critical of the SCSD’s teacher removal policies. 
				<br><br>
				The absentee rate in the SCSD is 57.4%. If students aren’t showing up to class in middle and high school, motivation to pursue college begins to dip.
				<br><br>
				According to the <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/pdf/higher-education-nys.pdf">New York State Education Department,</a> in 2022, there were 896,000 students enrolled across all postsecondary schools in New York State. “This was the lowest total enrollment over a 15-year Period. The drop was driven by the nearly 14 percent decline in enrollment at public institutions, where enrollment has been falling since 2018.” 
				<br><br>
				Without pursuance of postsecondary education, it is difficult to climb out of poverty – few employers are inclined to hire applicants without a degree and the ebbs and flows of the job market are unfamiliar. Turner believes that “education is the number one indicator of quality of life.” Statistically, a resident's educational status is one of the strongest correlations of their impoverished status. 
				<br><br><iframe class=img2 title="Relationship between Education and Economics" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-HItdu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HItdu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 50% !important; border: none;" height="485" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
				</script>
				Over a third of Syracuse residents who have no college degree live below the poverty line. On the other hand, just over 85% of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher are avoiding a life of poverty. These correlations run true on a national level as well: <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/2021/10/26/datapoints-education-income-and-poverty/#:~:text=For%20those%20with%20some%20college,increase%20from%207.8%25%20in%202019.">The U.S. Census</a> shows 25% of residents without a degree live in poverty with 92% of college graduates sitting above the line. 
				
				<br><br>
				According to the U.S. Census Bureau, New York residents with only a high school diploma bring home just shy of $44,000 annually on average while those with a college degree earn over $80,000.
				<br><br>
				Syracuse was one of just six U.S. cities with a child poverty rate over 40%. A total of 33 places had child poverty rates over 30%.
				<br><br>
				The city’s poverty rate has been steadily dropping over the last few years, but this year's boom leaves us wondering how Syracuse’s students will approach their education.
